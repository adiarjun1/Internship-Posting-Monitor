JobWatcher is an automated internship‐monitoring service that lets you subscribe to any company’s job listing page and receive instant email alerts when new software‐engineering internships go live. 
It bundles a FastAPI backend (with CRUD endpoints and Swagger UI), a Celery/Playwright scraper that runs every five minutes against your watched URLs, Redis for task queuing, and SendGrid for notifications—all containerized via Docker Compose. 
To get started, just clone this repo, copy and populate .env.example with your SendGrid credentials, then run: docker compose up --build. Visit http://localhost:8000/docs to add or remove watches.
